# Example

This is a simple example of the custom-element-docgen integration in action.

You can view the code inside of `astro.config.mjs`, and you can view the components in the `example-components` directory.

The examples showcase a mix of:
- Vanilla and Lit web components
- JavaScript and TypeScript
- With and without JSDoc annotations
- Different libraries (e.g., Shoelace and Lion)

## Running the example

1. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
2. Run the Astro project

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4321`
